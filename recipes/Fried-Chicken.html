        <h3>Recipe instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a shallow bowl or dish, mix together the flour, salt, paprika, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne pepper (if using). This mixture will be used as the coating for the chicken.</li>
            <li>Rinse the chicken pieces and pat them dry with paper towels.</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a deep pan or skillet over medium heat. The oil should be about 1-2 inches deep.</li>
            <li>Dip each chicken piece into the flour mixture, making sure it is coated on all sides. Shake off any excess flour.</li>
            <li>Carefully place the coated chicken pieces into the hot oil, skin-side down. Be cautious to avoid overcrowding the pan.</li>
            <li>Fry the chicken for about 6-8 minutes on each side until golden brown and cooked through. The internal temperature should reach 165°F (75°C).</li>
            <li>Remove the fried chicken from the oil and place it on a paper towel-lined plate to drain off any excess oil.</li>
            <li>Repeat the process for the remaining chicken pieces.</li>
            <li>Let the fried chicken rest for a few minutes before serving to allow it to cool slightly and become crispier.</li>
            <li>Serve the fried chicken hot as a main course or as part of a meal with your favorite side dishes such as mashed potatoes, coleslaw, or cornbread.</li>
